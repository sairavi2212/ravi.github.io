A good number of companies visit each year, and students get placed with a good package.
College provides a good stipend and has almost negligible fees for MS and PhD students.
The institute is focused on research. The labs are very good, but the extracurricular activities are not as good.
Hostel life at IIIT Hyderabad was my first ever experience of this kind, but I was really happy with the facilities we received there.
The teaching staff shows interest in our careers and has molded me into a very good resource for IT companies.
